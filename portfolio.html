  <h1>How Dreadlocks Morocco Was Born</h1>
  
  <p>
    After graduating, I had no money, no plan — I was broke. One day, during meditation, while I had my dreadlocks, a message came from the universe:
    <strong>“Why not start a dreadlocks business?”</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    That one moment changed everything. I followed the idea, and step by step, I created <strong>Dreadlocks Morocco</strong> — a business to help people maintain, repair, and celebrate their dreadlocks with love and care.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the beginning, I worked with people from all walks of life. Their stories, our shared laughs, the lessons — these powerful moments inspired me to create a <strong>documentary</strong>, coming soon here in this portfolio.
  </p>

  <p>
    But I didn’t stop there. Now, I’m also building something new: a natural cosmetic brand based on Morocco’s famous <strong>argan oil</strong>, made especially for dreadlocks and natural hair.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is more than a business. It’s a spiritual journey, a healing process, and a way to build a community. Thank you for being part of it.
